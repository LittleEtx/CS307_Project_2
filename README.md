## Introduction

This is the second project of CS307 Database System. The project is to build a database system for a delivery company
SUSTC.
More information can be found in the file `CS307-2022Fall-Project2.pdf`.

The whole project can be seperated into three parts: database system (using postgresql), server that accesses to the
database
and client (using javafx) for logging in and manipulate data.

We spend a lot of time on the client design, here are the screenshots.
